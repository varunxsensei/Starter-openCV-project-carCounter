# 🚗 Vehicle Detection using YOLOv8

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a **starter computer vision project** that utilizes **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)** for real-time object detection. It focuses on detecting vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, motorbikes) in a video stream, drawing bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores.

## 📌 Features
- **🚗 Object Detection**: Identifies and classifies vehicles in a given video.
- **🎥 Real-time Processing**: Uses OpenCV for capturing and displaying video frames.
- **🎭 Region Masking**: Applies a custom mask to focus on specific areas of interest.
- **📏 Bounding Box Visualization**: Uses `cvzone` for visually enhanced bounding boxes and labels.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **🐍 Python**
- **📸 OpenCV**
- **🏎️ Ultralytics YOLOv8**
- **🎨 cvzone**
- **🔢 NumPy**
